# KitabGhar-Recommend-API
This repo holds the source code of the entire Recommender System, I coded for my native project: [KitabGhar](https://github.com/jaykay12/KitabGhar)

#### Recommendations are generated for any user of KitabGhar platform on two basis:
- [x] Popularity-based Recommendations
- [x] Item-Item based Collaborative Filtering Recommendations
- [ ] User-User based Collaborative Filtering Recommendations

## Tech-Stack
 - Python 3
 - API written in Flask
 - [KitabGhar](https://github.com/jaykay12/KitabGhar) supports MySQL, so Python-MySQL connectivity achieved using mysqlclient
 - Unit tests written using PyTest

Please find the build instructions associated with the Recommend API at [Run-API.md](Run-API.md)

Please find blog post about Collaborative Filtering written by me at [Tech Blog](https://jaykay12.github.io/tech/)
